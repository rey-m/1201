Usage of this technology rewarded with loyalty bonuses, discounts in favorite areas, split payment between you and your friends and special deals for usage of new technology (AT hop cards).
Minimalize the spread of viruses and diseases as money is known to be very good at transmitting diseases(Time, 2017.).
AT hop cards, which contains the microchips, are meant to last 6 years durability-wise and give discounts to students, hoping for more people to use public transport rather than their own way of travel, such as through driving. ​​"

<h1>CTiS: Impact of Technology Site</h1>


</ul><p>This mock-up site is intended to support your team project so you can take this as a set of files and as a starting point and adapt it to your preference. 
It is built on a W3C site tutorial so does not claim to be flash, but now has an image, [of a paper we wrote a while back on CSED4G (Computing Education for the Social Good)]</p>
<p>The site is not particularly well presented, but as the site uses HTML and has been styled with CSS it can be regarded as a <em>"minimum viable product"</em> for the purposes of this project&hellip;
It has some default links, which you can take as a start for your site structure.  The <em>Process Support </em>Links provides guidance which will be needed for presenting your final project. </p>

<h1> Technology Risks </h1>
<h4>
<p>
If you were to lose or damage your transport card containing said microchip.

As for environmental concerns, plastic is used in producing cards.
</p>
<p></p>
</h4>
<h1> Technology Choices</h1>
<h4>
<p>
There are many choices available when choosing this method of transport
Tags, keychains and cards. You can make the choice in which you prefer.
Use different mode of transport like buses, trains, scooters, bikes, carpool, and more.
Able to change to this technology instead of the other older alternatives.
Choice for an easier way of transport and more accessibility.
AT Hop made the movement in 2017 to encourage people to leave the cars and use buses, this would lead to the increase in Hop card usage, showing the importance of microchips and there usage.
